            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Buckwheat noodles are a healthier alternative to wheat noodles. They are higher in protein and lower in calories, making it the perfect noodles for those trying to eat healthier.

            <ol>
                
                <li>Boil the Korean buckwheat noodles until al dente, then immediately drain and rinse under cold water. The cold water will prevent the noodles from further cooking, as well as "get rid of the starch" according to Jungkook.</li>
                <li>Make the makguksu noodle sauce: In a small bowl, combine the perilla oil, Cham sauce, Buldak sauce, and Buldak mayo. Mix until well combined.</li>
                <li>Drizzle the entire bowl of sauce on top of the cold buckwheat noodles, mix until the noodles and sauce are well incorporated.</li>
                <li>Garnish with an egg yolk and seaweed: Make a divot in the centre of the sauced noodles, and gently slide the egg yolk in. Garnish with roasted seaweed flakes.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately by popping the egg yolk and mixing it in with the rest of the noodles. Enjoy!</li>

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>BTS Jungkook again! Previously, the singer shared another experimental instant ramen recipe on Weverse, combining two popular ramen brands, Samyang’s Buldak, and Nongshim’s Noguri. He called the dish “Bulgueri,” and the recipe was such a hit that Nongshim reportedly registered “Bulgueri” for trademarking!
                However, he has recently updated the recipe! This viral noodle recipe was showcased by Jungkook, himself, in an early-morning Weverse livestream on April 24, 2023 at 6 AM (KST). During his recent livestream, when he started talking about his new recipe, Jungkook was fighting the urge to make some for himself and share it with ARMYs as well. After a few minutes of debating, he started whipping ingredients and boiling buckwheat noodles on the stove.
                Below are the links to the livestream, and the post about the updated recipe!<br>
