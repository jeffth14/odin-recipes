                <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>

                <li>7 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
                <li>1½ tablespoons tomato paste</li>
                <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 cups dry red wine</li>
                <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
                <li>2 cups water</li>
                <li>1 bay leaf</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
                <li>1½ teaspoons sugar</li>
                <li>4 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks on a diagonal</li>
                <li>1 pound small white boiling potatoes (baby yukons), cut in half</li>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove any large chunks of fat that are easy to get to, but don’t overdo it with the trimming, as the fat helps make the beef tender.</li>
                <li>Season the meat generously with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Heat a bit of oil in a Dutch oven or large pot and brown the meat in batches (Note: it’s important not to crowd the pan — if you try to brown all the meat at once, it will steam instead of sear and you won’t get all that lovely color and flavour).</li>
                <li>Remove the meat and add the onions, garlic, and balsamic vinegar to the pan. The vinegar will loosen all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan and add flavour.</li>
                <li>Cook until the vegetables are softened, then add the tomato paste and cook for a minute more.</li>
                <li>Add the beef back into the pan and sprinkle with the flour.</li>
                <li>Stir until the flour is dissolved.</li>
                <li>Add the wine, broth, water, thyme, bay leaves, and sugar.</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil, then cover and braise in the oven for 2 hours.</li>
                <li>After 2 hours, add the carrots and potatoes.</li>
                <li>Return to the oven and continue cooking for one hour, or until the meat is fork-tender, the broth is thickened, and the carrots and potatoes are tender.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
