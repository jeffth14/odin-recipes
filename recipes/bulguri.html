            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>K-pop star Jungkook dropped an original ramen recipe he dubbed "Bulguri," 
                after the two types of ramen he uses to make it: Buldak spicy chicken and Neoguri spicy seafood. 
                Fans can't stop talking about Jungkook's culinary creation, prompting Neoguri's parent company, 
                Nongshim, to jump on, trademarking the name Bulguri!

            <h2>Required ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Add water to a saucepan, and turn heat to high.</li>
                <li>Stir in Buldak sauce and half a packet of Neoguri powdered seasoning.</li>
                <li>When water boils, add the noodles.</li>
                <li>Once noodles are mostly cooked, add the remaining sesame seed and dried veggie packets.</li>
                <li>Transfer to a bowl, and drizzle with perilla or sesame oil.</li>
                <li>Top with a fried egg and green onions (optional).</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove any large chunks of fat that are easy to get to, but don’t overdo it with the trimming, as the fat helps make the beef tender.</li>
                <li>Season the meat generously with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Heat a bit of oil in a Dutch oven or large pot and brown the meat in batches (Note: it’s important not to crowd the pan — if you try to brown all the meat at once, it will steam instead of sear and you won’t get all that lovely color and flavour).</li>
                <li>Remove the meat and add the onions, garlic, and balsamic vinegar to the pan. The vinegar will loosen all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan and add flavour.</li>
                <li>Cook until the vegetables are softened, then add the tomato paste and cook for a minute more.</li>
                <li>Add the beef back into the pan and sprinkle with the flour.</li>
                <li>Stir until the flour is dissolved.</li>
                <li>Add the wine, broth, water, thyme, bay leaves, and sugar.</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil, then cover and braise in the oven for 2 hours.</li>
                <li>After 2 hours, add the carrots and potatoes.</li>
                <li>Return to the oven and continue cooking for one hour, or until the meat is fork-tender, the broth is thickened, and the carrots and potatoes are tender.</li>
                
            </ol>

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>As a huge fan of the Korean superstars BTS, I didn't want to miss out on trying this viral recipe.
                Every BTS ramen moment goes viral among their fans, and most recently on Weverse (an online artist-to-fan community app), BTS member Jung Kook shared a recipe for what he called “Bulguri.”
                The name is a portmanteau for Buldak Spicy Chicken and Neoguri Spicy Seafood, the two instant Korean ramens he used to create the dish. e calls for finishing the ramen with perilla oil,
                 a deeply fragranced oil produced when the seeds of the perilla plant are cold-pressed. Below is the link to his viral post about the recipe!<br>
