            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <strong>For the pastry:</strong>
                <li>Combine the flour, salt, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a food processor or bowl if using your hands.</li>
                <li>Cut the butter into small chunks and add to the food processor or bowl. Working swiftly using your fingertip, pastry fork, or quick pulse in the food processor, combine the ingredients making sure to scoop the bottom of the bowl until it looks like a crumbly meal. Transfer into a bowl if using a food processor. Add the iced water to the bowl.</li>
                <li>With floured hands, mix and knead the dough until it forms a ball. Be careful not to over mix as this will make your dough very hard.</li>
                <li>Divide the dough into three pieces and flatten it into a thick round shape. Wrap in cling film and set them in the refrigerator to chill for about 30 minutes.</li>
                <strong>For the filling:</strong>
                <li>In a large skillet, add the minced beef and cook on medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Then add the onion and cook for a minute. Add the potato, carrot, and garlic. Cook for about 5 minutes until the meat is brown and moisture has vaporized. Add the seasoning powder, ginger, curry, salt, and pepper and continue stirring for another minute or two.</li>
                <li>Add the beef broth, scrape the sides and bottom to get everything that might have been stuck on the side or bottom of the pan. Cover and allow to cook for 5-6 minutes.</li>
                <li>Combine the cornstarch with a teaspoon of water, and stir it into the minced beef sauce. Add the thyme (stems removed). Once distributed, cover and reduce heat to low. Cook for about 6 minutes. You should have a stew-like consistency. Remove from heat and set aside to cool completely.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350¬∞F.</li>
                <li>On a floured surface, cut the dough into the number of patties you wish to make. Using a rolling pin, roll out each piece of dough into a circle (either using a meat pie cutter or round medium size mug).</li>
                <li>Whisk the egg yolk and 1 teaspoon of water for brushing.</li>
                <li>Scoop a spoonful of the cooled meat filling onto one side of the cut-out dough, leaving a few inches. Using a brush, brush the egg wash on the edge of the dough, fold one end of the dough to the other end.</li>
                <li>Crimp the edges with your finger and then with the tip of a fork providing a seal for the patties.</li>
                <li>Place the pies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Using the tip of a fork, poke 2-3 holes on the top of the pie to allow steam out while baking. Then brush the top of the pie with the egg wash.</li>
                <li>Place in the oven for 30 minutes or until pies turn golden in color.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and transfer to a cooling rack. Enjoy!</li>
