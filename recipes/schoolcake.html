            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oven to 180¬∞C/160¬∞C fan/gas 4. Butter a 20 x 30cm cake tin and line with baking parchment. Put the butter and sugar in a large bowl and beat with an electric whisk for a few minutes until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs, flour, milk, and vanilla, and beat again until you have a smooth batter.</li>
                <li>Scrape the batter into the prepared tin, spread right to the corners, and smooth the surface. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, checking at 5-minute intervals if it isn't ready after 45 minutes. Leave the sponge to cool on a wire rack.</li>
                <li>Mix the icing sugar with enough water to make a thick icing. Spread the icing over the cooled cake, then top with lots of sprinkles ‚Äì the surface should be almost completely covered. Leave for at least 1 hour to set. Cut into squares and serve with hot custard, if you like.</li>
            </ol>
